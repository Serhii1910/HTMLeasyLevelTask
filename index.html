		<h3>The definition</h3>

	<div class="introduction">
		A power transformer is a static machine used for transforming power from one circuit to another without changing frequency. This is a very basic <b>definition of transformer</b>. Since, there is no rotating or moving part, so a transformer is a static device. Transformer operates on an ac supply. A transformer works on the principle of mutual induction.

	<div class="basicInformation">
		<p>A single phase voltage transformer basically consists of two electrical coils of wire, one called the “Primary Winding” and another called the “Secondary Winding”. For this tutorial we will define the “primary” side of the transformer as the side that usually takes power, and the “secondary” as the side that usually delivers power. In a single-phase voltage transformer the primary is usually the side with the higher voltage.</p>
		<p>These two coils are not in electrical contact with each other but are instead wrapped together around a common closed magnetic iron circuit called the “core”. This soft iron core is not solid but made up of individual laminations connected together to help reduce the core’s losses.</p>
		<p>The two coil windings are electrically isolated from each other but are magnetically linked through the common core allowing electrical power to be transferred from one coil to the other. When an electric current passed through the primary winding, a magnetic field is developed which induces a voltage into the secondary winding as shown.</p>
